# Experiment 25: Mamba on MC_RTT
# ==================================================
# The Navigation Filter - Mamba as a Neural Kalman Filter
#
# HYPOTHESIS:
# MC_RTT is continuous random target tracking where context IS the trajectory.
# Mamba's stateful hidden state acts as trajectory memory.
#
# Key differences from MC_Maze:
# - Window: 2 seconds (80 bins) - long context matters
# - No shuffle: sequential batches for stateful training
# - Stateful: model maintains h_t across the session
#
# TARGET: R² > 0.70
