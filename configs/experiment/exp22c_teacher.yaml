# Experiment 22c: Multi-Seed Teacher Distillation
# ==================================================
# Ensemble of transformers for robust teaching signal
#
# From RESEARCH_LOG: Architecture alone is insufficient.
# Need identical augmentation, dropout, lr settings.
#
# Best result: R² = 0.7159
